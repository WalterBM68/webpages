                I want to visit the city of Durban just for holidays because that city is warm and it's sea is
                warm too so I just wanna be there and experience all that cool and warm weather.
                Many people says Durban is clean and safe for tourists, I think that attracks me because I'll be
                safe while I'm enjoying myself in that part of South Africa. Durban is also not that
                far from Johannesburg so I think it will not be that hard to visit it.

                    . Those who knows this language says it's easy to learn so I want to try it and see, It's
                    important to be multilingual.

                        was
                        a difficult day for Soweto residense especially the ones from Diepkloof, Orlando and Chiawelo
                        because many students were killed by police officers
                        while they were protesting. There was a chaos in this place I'm at where buildings(including
                        West Rand Administrative buildings) and vehicles were burnt
                        down by the angry students.

                        Sharpeville township on the 21 of March 1960(today it's called a Human rights day).
                        It was also a dark day for Sharpeville residence because they saw something that they thought
                        they'll see in their lives. Sharpeville is a black
                        township located near Vereeniging in Gauteng where this tragedy happened. People were marching
                        on the streets and police officers killed them just like
                        that.
