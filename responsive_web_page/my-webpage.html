                    I want to visit the city of Durban just for holidays because that city is warm and it's sea is
                    warm too so I just wanna be there and experience all that cool and warm weather.
                    Many people says Durban is clean and safe for tourists, I think that attracks me because I'll be
                    safe while I'm enjoying myself in that part of South Africa. Durban is also not that
                    far from Johannesburg so I think it will not be that hard to visit it.

                    I would like to learn French language because this is an international language that is used by
                    many countries especially African, I think we have 24 African countries that speak French
                    . Those who knows this language says it's easy to learn so I want to try it and see, It's
                    important to be multilingual.

                    This township it's in Soweto, it's called Diepkloof where the youth of Soweto were protesting
                    against poor and Bantu education, it was the 16th of June 1976(today it's called Youth day). It
                    was
                    a difficult day for Soweto residense especially the ones from Diepkloof, Orlando and Chiawelo
                    because many students were killed by police officers
                    while they were protesting. There was a chaos in this place I'm at where buildings(including
                    West Rand Administrative buildings) and vehicles were burnt
                    down by the angry students.

                    Here I'm in Sharpeville police station, we'll remember that police officers killed many people in
                    Sharpeville township on the 21 of March 1960(today it's called a Human rights day).
                    It was also a dark day for Sharpeville residence because they saw something that they thought
                    they'll see in their lives. Sharpeville is a black
                    township located near Vereeniging in Gauteng where this tragedy happened. People were marching
                    on the streets and police officers killed them just like
                    that.
